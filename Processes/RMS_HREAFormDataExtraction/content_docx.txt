Project Overview

Q1.1 Project Title:
Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma); a retrospective pathological review

Q1.2 Summary of the research project:
Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma) is one of several cystic lesions that may be encountered in the retrorectal/presacral space. Their histogenesis is unknown, possibly representing a subtype of teratoma or vestigial remnant of the hindgut.  The true risk of malignant transformation is unknown.  
Aim: to review the pathological features of all cases of tailgut cyst at Envoi Pathology in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, USA.  Demographic data (age, gender), cyst size, multiloculation, types of epithelium, the presence of cyst rupture and neoplasia will be recorded. Data will be collected independently at both research sites and collated.  
Expected outcomes: It is expected that the majority of cases will be large multiloculated cysts predominantly occurring in middle age females. A small percentage of cases may show neoplastic transformation, which will require further characterisation.

Histopathology sections from cases of previously diagnosed tailgut cyst in resection specimens.

M2.2 Will you be collecting biospecimens prospectively?
No


M2.3 Will you be using biospecimens from one or more existing archives or biobanks?
Yes

Details for each archive or biobank
M2.3.1 Name of archive or biobank

M2.3.2 Confirmation of access to the biospecimens

M2.3.3 Is use of the biospecimens consistent with the consent obtained at the time the biospecimens were collected?
M2.3.3.1 Evidence of the consent obtained at the time the biospecimens were collected (optional)

Envoi Pathology archive
Yes
Yes
See attachment 


M2.4 Will you be importing and/or exporting biospecimens internationally?

 Neither importing or exporting biospecimens





M2.5 Will you be obtaining post-mortem biospecimens? 
No

M2.6 Will you be performing any genetic or genomic testing, investigation or analysis of the biospecimens?
No

M2.7 Will the biospecimens be destroyed at the conclusion of the project or will they be retained for future use?
Biospecimens will be destroyed. 
Biospecimens will be retained for future use. 


M2.7.2.1 Describe which biospecimens will be retained, any intended future use/s and any arrangements for future access to the biospecimens?
The slides will be reviewed from existing diagnostic cases and will be returned to the archives of the laboratory after review.

M2.8 Having regard to the answers to the above questions, describe any ethical considerations related to your collection, use and analysis of biospecimens, with specific attention to consent, management of findings and future use of the biospecimens.
The study is a retrospective analysis of tissue that has already been examined by a histopathologist. 
The tissue sections are required to be kept for a minimum of 7 years after their original receipt. These are stored in the tissue files at Envoi pathology. They will be retrieved, examined and returned to the files afterwards.
If a new significant finding was made upon review of the tissue sections, for example a premalignant/malignant process was detected, the process would be:
1) Discuss this with the original reporting pathologist
2) Contact the original referring doctor (who provided the tissue sample) to advise of the new finding.
3) Issue a further report with the updated finding.
The disease process under investigation in unlikely to be associated with any new significant findings that would require this process to be enacted.




















Participant Specific Questions











Recruitment Questions
{{/17 Show Recruitment Questions}}
As the research involves Human biospecimens only, no recruitment questions were asked. Any issues related to the biospecimens and consent to their use are addressed in the Biospecimen Analysis Section and Consent Section.


Consent Questions


Q2.2.7 Are you proposing to use an opt-out approach with respect to some or all of the participants?
No


Q2.2.8 Are you requesting a waiver of the requirement for consent with respect to some or all participants?
Yes

 Q2.2.8.1 How will you ensure that the research satisfies the guidance for waiving consent as listed in National Statement 2.3.10?
This audit comprises 'negligible risk research' as there is no foreseeable risk of harm or discomfort. The benefits of this research (gains in knowledge, insight and understanding of tailgut cyst) are expected to outweigh the negligible risk of harm. In addition, it is not practical to obtain consent from a large retrospective cohort of patients, many years after biopsy/resection and there is no known reason for thinking that participants would not have consented if asked. All collected data will be deidentified and will remain at Envoi Pathology. All associated deidentified research documents will be password protected. If there is an outcome with significant impact on participant welfare, information arising from the research will be made available to the patients. There is no known possibility of commercial exploitation of derivatives of the data. This waiver is not prohibited by state, federal or international law

1Royal Brisbane and Womenâ€™s Hospital, Brisbane, Australia; 
2Envoi Specialist Pathologists, Brisbane, Australia;
3University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia;
4Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA. 

Resources
The resources required for this audit include archived cases of previously diagnosed tailgut cyst at Envoi Pathology, Brisbane. This is a collaborative project with Dr R Graham at the Mayo Clinic, USA. The data from the Mayo Clinic will be collected independently by Dr Graham and collated with the Queensland data as part of this large retrospective review. No funding is being sought for this project. 
Background
Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma) is one of several cystic lesions that may be encountered in the retrorectal/presacral space. Their histogenesis is unknown, possibly representing a subtype of teratoma or vestigial remnant of the hindgut. To date the limited published data comprises single case reports or small series, with a bias to cases associated with neoplasia, resulting in a published rate of neoplastic transformation of 26.6%. This study was undertaken to review the pathological findings of an unselected large series of tailgut cysts.
Project Design
Research project setting: The research project will be conducted at Envoi Pathology, in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, USA.
Methodological approach: Cases will be identified using a retrospective database search. All cases of histologically confirmed tailgut cyst will be included.  
Participants: All cases of of histologically confirmed tailgut cyst will be included. 
Participant recruitment strategies and timeframes: Not applicable.
Approach/es to provision of information to participants and/or consent (as required in addition to that outlined in the HREA): We are requesting a waiver of the requirement for consent with respect to all participants, on the basis of this project posing negligible risk to participants, with no foreseeable risk of harm or discomfort. 
Research Activities: The length of the project is expected to be up to 6 months. The database and archived tissue and slides will be accessed at Envoi Pathology. De-identified data will be collated in an excel spreadsheet and de-identified macroscopic and microscopic photographs of a small number of cases will be stored in a password protected folder at Envoi Pathology. 
Data Collection/Gathering: The collected data will be de-identified. The following data will be recorded: demographic data (age and gender), cyst size, multiloculation, types of epithelium present (squamous, columnar, transitional between squamous and columnar), presence and type of neoplasia, presence of cyst rupture, and features in the cyst wall (smooth muscle, inflammation, calcification, heterotopic bone etc).  De-identified macroscopic and microscopic photographs of select cases may be used as part of the manuscript.  
Data Management: Data will be stored at Envoi Pathology. The de-identified data will be password protected. All researchers will have access to the data. Following the completion of this project, the collected data pertaining to this research will be stored at Envoi Pathology. 
Data Analysis: The macroscopic and microscopic features of tailgut cyst will be analysed. The frequency of neoplastic transformation in this unselected population will be determined as well as the different types of neoplasia that arise in these lesions.  
Data Linkage: Not applicable. 
Outcome measures: The measured outcomes include: types of epithelium present, presence and type of neoplasia, presence of cyst rupture, and features in the cyst wall (smooth muscle, inflammation, calcification, heterotopic bone).   
For research involving an investigational drug or device as part of a clinical trial: Not applicable. 
Results, Outcomes and Future Plans
Plans for return of results or findings of research to participants: Research participants will be able to access the results/findings of this research once published.
Plans for dissemination and publication of project outcomes: The outcomes of this project are expected to be published in a peer reviewed medical research journal. 
Other potential uses of the data at the end of the project: None known. 
Project closure processes: Not applicable. 
Plans for sharing and/or future use of data and/or follow-up research: There is no anticipated secondary use of data.

Project Description

Title: Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma); a retrospective pathological review (version 1)

Project Team Roles & Responsibilities
Anna Sokolova1, 3, Ian Brown1,2, 3, Christophe Rosty2,3, Rondell Graham4. 
1Royal Brisbane and Womenâ€™s Hospital, Brisbane, Australia; 
2Envoi Specialist Pathologists, Brisbane, Australia;
3University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia;
4Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA. 

Resources
The resources required for this audit include archived cases of previously diagnosed tailgut cyst at Envoi Pathology, Brisbane. This is a collaborative project with Dr R Graham at the Mayo Clinic, USA. The data from the Mayo Clinic will be collected independently by Dr Graham and collated with the Queensland data as part of this large retrospective review. No funding is being sought for this project. 
Background
Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma) is one of several cystic lesions that may be encountered in the retrorectal/presacral space. Their histogenesis is unknown, possibly representing a subtype of teratoma or vestigial remnant of the hindgut. To date the limited published data comprises single case reports or small series, with a bias to cases associated with neoplasia, resulting in a published rate of neoplastic transformation of 26.6%. This study was undertaken to review the pathological findings of an unselected large series of tailgut cysts.
Project Design
Research project setting: The research project will be conducted at Envoi Pathology, in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, USA.
Methodological approach: Cases will be identified using a retrospective database search. All cases of histologically confirmed tailgut cyst will be included.  
Participants: All cases of of histologically confirmed tailgut cyst will be included. 
Participant recruitment strategies and timeframes: Not applicable.
Approach/es to provision of information to participants and/or consent (as required in addition to that outlined in the HREA): We are requesting a waiver of the requirement for consent with respect to all participants, on the basis of this project posing negligible risk to participants, with no foreseeable risk of harm or discomfort. 
Research Activities: The length of the project is expected to be up to 6 months. The database and archived tissue and slides will be accessed at Envoi Pathology. De-identified data will be collated in an excel spreadsheet and de-identified macroscopic and microscopic photographs of a small number of cases will be stored in a password protected folder at Envoi Pathology. 
Data Collection/Gathering: The collected data will be de-identified. The following data will be recorded: demographic data (age and gender), cyst size, multiloculation, types of epithelium present (squamous, columnar, transitional between squamous and columnar), presence and type of neoplasia, presence of cyst rupture, and features in the cyst wall (smooth muscle, inflammation, calcification, heterotopic bone etc).  De-identified macroscopic and microscopic photographs of select cases may be used as part of the manuscript.  
Data Management: Data will be stored at Envoi Pathology. The de-identified data will be password protected. All researchers will have access to the data. Following the completion of this project, the collected data pertaining to this research will be stored at Envoi Pathology. 
Data Analysis: The macroscopic and microscopic features of tailgut cyst will be analysed. The frequency of neoplastic transformation in this unselected population will be determined as well as the different types of neoplasia that arise in these lesions.  
Data Linkage: Not applicable. 
Outcome measures: The measured outcomes include: types of epithelium present, presence and type of neoplasia, presence of cyst rupture, and features in the cyst wall (smooth muscle, inflammation, calcification, heterotopic bone).   
For research involving an investigational drug or device as part of a clinical trial: Not applicable. 
Results, Outcomes and Future Plans
Plans for return of results or findings of research to participants: Research participants will be able to access the results/findings of this research once published.
Plans for dissemination and publication of project outcomes: The outcomes of this project are expected to be published in a peer reviewed medical research journal. 
Other potential uses of the data at the end of the project: None known. 
Project closure processes: Not applicable. 
Plans for sharing and/or future use of data and/or follow-up research: There is no anticipated secondary use of data.

Project Overview

Q1.1 Project Title:
Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma); a retrospective pathological review

Q1.2 Summary of the research project:
Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma) is one of several cystic lesions that may be encountered in the retrorectal/presacral space. Their histogenesis is unknown, possibly representing a subtype of teratoma or vestigial remnant of the hindgut.  The true risk of malignant transformation is unknown.  
Aim: to review the pathological features of all cases of tailgut cyst at Envoi Pathology in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, USA.  Demographic data (age, gender), cyst size, multiloculation, types of epithelium, the presence of cyst rupture and neoplasia will be recorded. Data will be collected independently at both research sites and collated.  
Expected outcomes: It is expected that the majority of cases will be large multiloculated cysts predominantly occurring in middle age females. A small percentage of cases may show neoplastic transformation, which will require further characterisation.

Project Description

Title: Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma); a retrospective pathological review (version 1)

Project Team Roles & Responsibilities
Anna Sokolova1, 3, Ian Brown1,2, 3, Christophe Rosty2,3, Rondell Graham4. 
1Royal Brisbane and Womenâ€™s Hospital, Brisbane, Australia; 
2Envoi Specialist Pathologists, Brisbane, Australia;
3University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia;
4Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA. 

Resources
The resources required for this audit include archived cases of previously diagnosed tailgut cyst at Envoi Pathology, Brisbane. This is a collaborative project with Dr R Graham at the Mayo Clinic, USA. The data from the Mayo Clinic will be collected independently by Dr Graham and collated with the Queensland data as part of this large retrospective review. No funding is being sought for this project. 
Background
Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma) is one of several cystic lesions that may be encountered in the retrorectal/presacral space. Their histogenesis is unknown, possibly representing a subtype of teratoma or vestigial remnant of the hindgut. To date the limited published data comprises single case reports or small series, with a bias to cases associated with neoplasia, resulting in a published rate of neoplastic transformation of 26.6%. This study was undertaken to review the pathological findings of an unselected large series of tailgut cysts.
Project Design
Research project setting: The research project will be conducted at Envoi Pathology, in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, USA.
Methodological approach: Cases will be identified using a retrospective database search. All cases of histologically confirmed tailgut cyst will be included.  
Participants: All cases of of histologically confirmed tailgut cyst will be included. 
Participant recruitment strategies and timeframes: Not applicable.
Approach/es to provision of information to participants and/or consent (as required in addition to that outlined in the HREA): We are requesting a waiver of the requirement for consent with respect to all participants, on the basis of this project posing negligible risk to participants, with no foreseeable risk of harm or discomfort. 
Research Activities: The length of the project is expected to be up to 6 months. The database and archived tissue and slides will be accessed at Envoi Pathology. De-identified data will be collated in an excel spreadsheet and de-identified macroscopic and microscopic photographs of a small number of cases will be stored in a password protected folder at Envoi Pathology. 
Data Collection/Gathering: The collected data will be de-identified. The following data will be recorded: demographic data (age and gender), cyst size, multiloculation, types of epithelium present (squamous, columnar, transitional between squamous and columnar), presence and type of neoplasia, presence of cyst rupture, and features in the cyst wall (smooth muscle, inflammation, calcification, heterotopic bone etc).  De-identified macroscopic and microscopic photographs of select cases may be used as part of the manuscript.  
Data Management: Data will be stored at Envoi Pathology. The de-identified data will be password protected. All researchers will have access to the data. Following the completion of this project, the collected data pertaining to this research will be stored at Envoi Pathology. 
Data Analysis: The macroscopic and microscopic features of tailgut cyst will be analysed. The frequency of neoplastic transformation in this unselected population will be determined as well as the different types of neoplasia that arise in these lesions.  
Data Linkage: Not applicable. 
Outcome measures: The measured outcomes include: types of epithelium present, presence and type of neoplasia, presence of cyst rupture, and features in the cyst wall (smooth muscle, inflammation, calcification, heterotopic bone).   
For research involving an investigational drug or device as part of a clinical trial: Not applicable. 
Results, Outcomes and Future Plans
Plans for return of results or findings of research to participants: Research participants will be able to access the results/findings of this research once published.
Plans for dissemination and publication of project outcomes: The outcomes of this project are expected to be published in a peer reviewed medical research journal. 
Other potential uses of the data at the end of the project: None known. 
Project closure processes: Not applicable. 
Plans for sharing and/or future use of data and/or follow-up research: There is no anticipated secondary use of data.

Project Overview

Q1.1 Project Title:
Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma); a retrospective pathological review

Q1.2 Summary of the research project:
Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma) is one of several cystic lesions that may be encountered in the retrorectal/presacral space. Their histogenesis is unknown, possibly representing a subtype of teratoma or vestigial remnant of the hindgut.  The true risk of malignant transformation is unknown.  
Aim: to review the pathological features of all cases of tailgut cyst at Envoi Pathology in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, USA.  Demographic data (age, gender), cyst size, multiloculation, types of epithelium, the presence of cyst rupture and neoplasia will be recorded. Data will be collected independently at both research sites and collated.  
Expected outcomes: It is expected that the majority of cases will be large multiloculated cysts predominantly occurring in middle age females. A small percentage of cases may show neoplastic transformation, which will require further characterisation.

M2.2 Will you be collecting biospecimens prospectively?
No


M2.3 Will you be using biospecimens from one or more existing archives or biobanks?
Yes

Details for each archive or biobank
M2.3.1 Name of archive or biobank

M2.3.2 Confirmation of access to the biospecimens

M2.3.3 Is use of the biospecimens consistent with the consent obtained at the time the biospecimens were collected?
M2.3.3.1 Evidence of the consent obtained at the time the biospecimens were collected (optional)

Envoi Pathology archive
Yes
Yes
See attachment 


M2.4 Will you be importing and/or exporting biospecimens internationally?

 Neither importing or exporting biospecimens





M2.5 Will you be obtaining post-mortem biospecimens? 
No

M2.6 Will you be performing any genetic or genomic testing, investigation or analysis of the biospecimens?
No

M2.7 Will the biospecimens be destroyed at the conclusion of the project or will they be retained for future use?
Biospecimens will be destroyed. 
Biospecimens will be retained for future use. 


M2.7.2.1 Describe which biospecimens will be retained, any intended future use/s and any arrangements for future access to the biospecimens?
The slides will be reviewed from existing diagnostic cases and will be returned to the archives of the laboratory after review.

M2.8 Having regard to the answers to the above questions, describe any ethical considerations related to your collection, use and analysis of biospecimens, with specific attention to consent, management of findings and future use of the biospecimens.
The study is a retrospective analysis of tissue that has already been examined by a histopathologist.Â 
The tissue sections are required to be kept for a minimum of 7 years after their original receipt. These are stored in the tissue files at Envoi pathology. They will be retrieved, examined and returned to the files afterwards.
If a new significant finding was made upon review of the tissue sections, for example a premalignant/malignant process was detected, the process would be:
1) Discuss this with the original reporting pathologist
2) Contact the original referring doctor (who provided the tissue sample) to advise of the new finding.
3) Issue a further report with the updated finding.
The disease process under investigation in unlikely to be associated with any new significant findings that would require this process to be enacted.




















Participant Specific Questions











Recruitment Questions
{{/17 Show Recruitment Questions}}
As the research involves Human biospecimens only, no recruitment questions were asked. Any issues related to the biospecimens and consent to their use are addressed in the Biospecimen Analysis Section and Consent Section.


Consent Questions


Q2.2.7 Are you proposing to use an opt-out approach with respect to some or all of the participants?

Project Overview

Q1.1 Project Title:
Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma); a retrospective pathological review

Q1.2 Summary of the research project:
Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma) is one of several cystic lesions that may be encountered in the retrorectal/presacral space. Their histogenesis is unknown, possibly representing a subtype of teratoma or vestigial remnant of the hindgut.  The true risk of malignant transformation is unknown.  
Aim: to review the pathological features of all cases of tailgut cyst at Envoi Pathology in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, USA.  Demographic data (age, gender), cyst size, multiloculation, types of epithelium, the presence of cyst rupture and neoplasia will be recorded. Data will be collected independently at both research sites and collated.  
Expected outcomes: It is expected that the majority of cases will be large multiloculated cysts predominantly occurring in middle age females. A small percentage of cases may show neoplastic transformation, which will require further characterisation.

Histopathology sections from cases of previously diagnosed tailgut cyst in resection specimens.

M2.2 Will you be collecting biospecimens prospectively?
No


M2.3 Will you be using biospecimens from one or more existing archives or biobanks?
Yes

Details for each archive or biobank
M2.3.1 Name of archive or biobank

M2.3.2 Confirmation of access to the biospecimens

M2.3.3 Is use of the biospecimens consistent with the consent obtained at the time the biospecimens were collected?
M2.3.3.1 Evidence of the consent obtained at the time the biospecimens were collected (optional)

Envoi Pathology archive
Yes
Yes
See attachment 


M2.4 Will you be importing and/or exporting biospecimens internationally?

 Neither importing or exporting biospecimens





M2.5 Will you be obtaining post-mortem biospecimens? 
No

M2.6 Will you be performing any genetic or genomic testing, investigation or analysis of the biospecimens?
No

M2.7 Will the biospecimens be destroyed at the conclusion of the project or will they be retained for future use?
Biospecimens will be destroyed. 
Biospecimens will be retained for future use. 


M2.7.2.1 Describe which biospecimens will be retained, any intended future use/s and any arrangements for future access to the biospecimens?
The slides will be reviewed from existing diagnostic cases and will be returned to the archives of the laboratory after review.

M2.8 Having regard to the answers to the above questions, describe any ethical considerations related to your collection, use and analysis of biospecimens, with specific attention to consent, management of findings and future use of the biospecimens.
The study is a retrospective analysis of tissue that has already been examined by a histopathologist.Â 
The tissue sections are required to be kept for a minimum of 7 years after their original receipt. These are stored in the tissue files at Envoi pathology. They will be retrieved, examined and returned to the files afterwards.
If a new significant finding was made upon review of the tissue sections, for example a premalignant/malignant process was detected, the process would be:
1) Discuss this with the original reporting pathologist
2) Contact the original referring doctor (who provided the tissue sample) to advise of the new finding.
3) Issue a further report with the updated finding.
The disease process under investigation in unlikely to be associated with any new significant findings that would require this process to be enacted.




















Participant Specific Questions











Recruitment Questions
{{/17 Show Recruitment Questions}}
As the research involves Human biospecimens only, no recruitment questions were asked. Any issues related to the biospecimens and consent to their use are addressed in the Biospecimen Analysis Section and Consent Section.


Consent Questions


Q2.2.7 Are you proposing to use an opt-out approach with respect to some or all of the participants?
No


Q2.2.8 Are you requesting a waiver of the requirement for consent with respect to some or all participants?
Yes

 Q2.2.8.1 How will you ensure that the research satisfies the guidance for waiving consent as listed in National Statement 2.3.10?
This audit comprises 'negligible risk research' as there is no foreseeable risk of harm or discomfort. The benefits of this research (gains in knowledge, insight and understanding of tailgut cyst) are expected to outweigh the negligible risk of harm. In addition, it is not practical to obtain consent from a large retrospective cohort of patients, many years after biopsy/resection and there is no known reason for thinking that participants would not have consented if asked. All collected data will be deidentified and will remain at Envoi Pathology. All associated deidentified research documents will be password protected. If there is an outcome with significant impact on participant welfare, information arising from the research will be made available to the patients. There is no known possibility of commercial exploitation of derivatives of the data. This waiver is not prohibited by state, federal or international law

1Royal Brisbane and Womenâ€™s Hospital, Brisbane, Australia; 
2Envoi Specialist Pathologists, Brisbane, Australia;
3University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia;
4Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA. 

Resources
The resources required for this audit include archived cases of previously diagnosed tailgut cyst at Envoi Pathology, Brisbane. This is a collaborative project with Dr R Graham at the Mayo Clinic, USA. The data from the Mayo Clinic will be collected independently by Dr Graham and collated with the Queensland data as part of this large retrospective review. No funding is being sought for this project. 
Background
Tailgut cyst (retrorectal cystic hamartoma) is one of several cystic lesions that may be encountered in the retrorectal/presacral space. Their histogenesis is unknown, possibly representing a subtype of teratoma or vestigial remnant of the hindgut. To date the limited published data comprises single case reports or small series, with a bias to cases associated with neoplasia, resulting in a published rate of neoplastic transformation of 26.6%. This study was undertaken to review the pathological findings of an unselected large series of tailgut cysts.
Project Design
Research project setting: The research project will be conducted at Envoi Pathology, in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, USA.
Methodological approach: Cases will be identified using a retrospective database search. All cases of histologically confirmed tailgut cyst will be included.  
Participants: All cases of of histologically confirmed tailgut cyst will be included. 
Participant recruitment strategies and timeframes: Not applicable.
Approach/es to provision of information to participants and/or consent (as required in addition to that outlined in the HREA): We are requesting a waiver of the requirement for consent with respect to all participants, on the basis of this project posing negligible risk to participants, with no foreseeable risk of harm or discomfort. 
Research Activities: The length of the project is expected to be up to 6 months. The database and archived tissue and slides will be accessed at Envoi Pathology. De-identified data will be collated in an excel spreadsheet and de-identified macroscopic and microscopic photographs of a small number of cases will be stored in a password protected folder at Envoi Pathology. 
Data Collection/Gathering: The collected data will be de-identified. The following data will be recorded: demographic data (age and gender), cyst size, multiloculation, types of epithelium present (squamous, columnar, transitional between squamous and columnar), presence and type of neoplasia, presence of cyst rupture, and features in the cyst wall (smooth muscle, inflammation, calcification, heterotopic bone etc).  De-identified macroscopic and microscopic photographs of select cases may be used as part of the manuscript.  
Data Management: Data will be stored at Envoi Pathology. The de-identified data will be password protected. All researchers will have access to the data. Following the completion of this project, the collected data pertaining to this research will be stored at Envoi Pathology. 
Data Analysis: The macroscopic and microscopic features of tailgut cyst will be analysed. The frequency of neoplastic transformation in this unselected population will be determined as well as the different types of neoplasia that arise in these lesions.  
Data Linkage: Not applicable. 
Outcome measures: The measured outcomes include: types of epithelium present, presence and type of neoplasia, presence of cyst rupture, and features in the cyst wall (smooth muscle, inflammation, calcification, heterotopic bone).
